                                been previously suspended or blocked, or during the time your Account has been temporarily blocked,
                                for any of the above reasons, you may not create another Account without our prior express
                                permission.
                              </p> <h4>3.2. Inactive account</h4> <p>
                                In order to use our Services, you must keep your Account active. If it is inactive for a period of
                                150 consecutive calendar days (i.e. you have leaved your Account balance unused during that time),
                                we may deem your Account inactive. If your account is flagged as inactive, you will get a respective
                                notification by email.
                              </p> <p>
                                Inactive accounts will be charged an inactive account fee to preserve your data. If on the last day
                                of the month your Account is marked inactive, an inactive account fee in the amount of EUR 15 will
                                be deducted from your Account balance on the first day of the following month.
                              </p> <p>
                                If you re-start using our Services during this process, your Account will be immediately marked as
                                active. You understand and agree that all fees already deducted during the inactive account process
                                will not be returned even if your Account status becomes active again. All deducted fees will be
                                displayed in your Account for your overview.
                              </p> <p>
                                If your Account balance is EUR 0, the Platform will automatically block your Account. You will
                                receive a notification informing you that your Account is blocked because of: &quot;Inactive account&quot;
                                status. After deactivation, you will have 45 calendar days to restore your account. To do so, you
                                have to login to your Account and follow the steps described there to restore your Account. If your
                                account is not reactivated within 45 calendar days, it will be archived without option to restore
                                it.
                              </p> <p>
                                In case you are no longer interested in using our Services and you wish to avoid inactive account
                                process, you must duly terminate your Agreement with us in accordance with this Terms.

                                You shall pay fees for the Services based on the invoices submitted by us. Unless agreed differently,
                                you must load funds to your Wallet in advance. The funds from your Wallet may be spent on any
                                Campaign type set up by you. If your Account balance becomes zero, all your Campaigns related with
                                your Wallet will be immediately paused.
                              </p> <p>
                                The fees for the Services provided by us are calculated based on the pricing model of the Campaign
                                type chosen by you and, if applicable, statistics gathered by us. Amount of daily Campaign Ads
                                spendings will be deducted from your Wallet balance on daily basis automatically. Amount payable for
                                Banner creation and Press-Releases will be deducted from your Wallet automatically after ordering
                                the relevant Service. All invoices generated by us shall be under automatic approval and must be
                                paid in full by you. You agree that you are entitled to a refund for delivered Services only in
                                cases explicitly set out in these Terms.

                                When you make a purchase, you agree to provide a valid funding account to proceed with payment. When
                                you have successfully completed the funding transaction, we will then transfer that value to your
                                Wallet balance and create an invoice. Pay attention to the details of the transaction, because your
                                total price may include taxes and fees, all of which you are responsible for funding. Upon payment
                                we may charge you with a processing fee or any other fee applicable by third party payment service

                                all of the criteria set in the terms and conditions for each payment method. You agree that we are
                                not responsible for any actions applied by the payment service provider including but not limited to
                                any additional transaction fees applied to your Account. We have the right to switch payment service
                                provider(s) at any time without notifying you. For each payment method, there are different account
                                thresholds for receiving and sending money that might be changed at any moment by us. We reserve the
                                right to reject a financial operation or change the list of available payment options.

                                All bonuses earned or granted to you are not eligible for refund. Bonuses can be used for Campaigns
                                only and are the last to be used.
                              </p> <h4>6.3. Refunds</h4> <p>You are entitled to request for a refund in the following cases:</p> <ol type="a"><li>if there has been an incorrect payment transaction;</li> <li>
                                  if you have made a prepayment and you prove that the actions forming the basis of the pricing
                                  model of your Campaign are based on a publisher’s fraudulent activities (i.e. the artificial
                                  increase of actions). In order to detect and prove publisher’s fraudulent activities you
                                  undertake to send to us a detailed report of sources/websites you consider to be fraudulent. In
                                  case the publisher’s fraudulent activities cannot be clearly identified based on your report, we
                                  are entitled to request additional proof from you. If you fail to submit a report or additional
                                  proof regarding the publisher’s fraudulent activities, we may refuse to give a refund and adjust
                                  your Account balance accordingly.
                                </li> <li>
                                  if at the end of the validity of the Agreement it appears that you have spent for the Services
                                  less than you have prepaid. In such a case you are entitled to ask for a refund within 30 days
                                  after the termination of the Agreement, provided that the amount of your unused Account balance
                                  is at least EUR 50. Before refunding, we will have to finalize all not invoiced spending and
                                  make necessary adjustments where needed. After finalizing all current statistics, your unused
                                  Account balance will be refunded to you at your request, minus an administrative fee of 15%
                                  (fifteen per cent) to cover our costs and fees related with the management of giving a refund,
                                  within 30 working days. Your refund will be created back to the same payment method and same
                                  payment account that you used to make your last payment. You may be required to provide
                                  additional information or documentation in order for us to confirm your identity, before any
                                  refund request is processed. Please be aware that if your Agreement with us is terminated due to
                                  the violation of the Agreement by you, we are entitled to a contractual penalty in the amount of
                                  your unused Account balance and therefore, we may refuse to make you a refund by way of set-off
                                  of the claims.

                                You agree that transaction fees could be applied to refunded payment(s), so we reserve the right to
                                deduct all transaction fees from your Account balance.
                              </p> <h4>6.4. Taxation</h4> <p>
                                If according to applicable law it is your responsibility to declare, pay or withhold taxes on or from
                                your transactions with us, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claim
                                arising out of your failure to do so. We perform our tax obligations according to the tax laws of
                                the Republic of Estonia. All payments to you from us in relation to our Services will be treated as
                                inclusive of tax (if applicable) and will not be adjusted.

                                We may cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates the Agreement, or if we believe
                                doing so may prevent financial loss. We may also cancel any income, bonuses, prepayment, and
                                adjustments as a result of fraudulent or illegal activity. In order to prevent financial loss to you
                                or to us, we may at our sole discretion and without incurring any liability, place a delay on a

                                to request a payment, or suspend/block your Account. In order to prevent financial loss to you or to
                                us, we may contact your funding instrument issuer, law enforcement, or affected third parties
                                (including other users) and share details of any payments you are associated with, if we believe
                                doing so may prevent financial loss or a violation of law.
                              </p> <p>
                                If you leave your Account balance unused for 150 consecutive days, or if you delete your account and
                                leave a balance, or if we suspend your Account and you do not meet any conditions necessary to
                                reinstate it within 150 days, we may process your Account balance to zero in accordance with these

                                therefore, we may refuse to make any payments to you by way of set-off of the claims.

                                    In case we find at our sole discretion that there is a threat that you are engaging in any suspicious
                                    activity, you have violated the Agreement or it is necessary for security reasons, we may
                                    temporarily suspend your Account until the cause for suspending your Account has been eliminated; or
                                    if that cannot be eliminated or you refuse or fail to eliminate it, block your Account and terminate
                                    the Agreement. For security reasons we may in addition block your access to the entire Website. You

                                    Account and/or the Website as a result of any violation of the Agreement by you. If your Account has
                                    been previously suspended or blocked, or during the time your Account has been temporarily blocked,
                                    for any of the above reasons, you may not create another Account without our prior express

                                  </p> <h4>3.2. Inactive account</h4> <p>
                                    In order to use our Services, you must keep your Account active. If it is inactive for a period of
                                    150 consecutive calendar days (i.e. you have not earned Commission during that time), we may deem
                                    your Account inactive. If your account is flagged as inactive, you will get a respective
                                    notification by email.
                                  </p> <p>
                                    Inactive accounts will be charged an inactive account fee to preserve your data. If on the last day
                                    of the month your Account is marked inactive, an inactive account fee in the amount of EUR 15 will
                                    be deducted from your Account balance on the first day of the following month.
                                  </p> <p>
                                    If you re-start using our Services during this process, your Account will be immediately marked as
                                    active. You understand and agree that all fees already deducted during the inactive account process
                                    will not be returned even if your Account status becomes active again. All deducted fees will be
                                    displayed in your Account for your overview.
                                  </p> <p>
                                    If your Account balance is EUR 0, the Platform will automatically block your Account. You will
                                    receive a notification informing you that your Account is blocked because of: &quot;Inactive account&quot;
                                    status. After deactivation, you will have 45 calendar days to restore your account. To do so, you
                                    have to login to your Account and follow the steps described there to restore your Account. If your
                                    account is not reactivated within 45 calendar days, it will be archived without option to restore
                                    it.
                                  </p> <p>
                                    In case you are no longer interested in using our Services and you wish to avoid inactive account
                                    process, you must duly terminate your Agreement with us in accordance with this Terms

                                    accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. Only our
                                    authorized employees, agents and contractors (who have agreed to keep personal data secure and
                                    confidential) have access to the personal data on a need to know basis.</p> <p>We store and process data, including personal data, in the EEA and possibly in other countries
                                    through third parties that we use to operate and manage the Services. When you access or use our
                                    Websites or the Services, or otherwise provide personal data to us, you are consenting, on behalf of
                                    you and your authorized agents, (and representing that you have the authority to provide such
                                    consent) to the processing and transfer of personal data in and to the other countries which may
                                    have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. We will take all steps
                                    reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with
                                    this Privacy Policy.</p> <p>Any payment transactions will be encrypted. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a
                                    password, which enables you to access certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping
                                    this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p> <p>You agree and acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the
                                    submission of data over the Internet may not be secure. We strive to use acceptable means to protect
                                    any personal data you share with us, however we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p> <h3>7. Data retention</h3> <p>We will retain your personal data only for so long as it is required for the purposes for which it
                                    was collected. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but only for so
                                    long as is reasonably necessary for us to pursue legitimate business interests, conduct audits,
                                    comply with (and demonstrate compliance with) legal obligations (e.g. taxation purposes), resolve
                                    disputes and enforce our agreements.</p> <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and
                                    sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
                                    your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve
                                    those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p> <p>When your personal data is no longer required, we will destroy, delete or convert it into an
                                    anonymous form.</p> <h3>8. Third-party links</h3> <p>The privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy apply to the Website and Services only. If you
                                    link to other web sites (including sites that offer or use the Services or are promoted by us) or
                                    use the services of other service providers, please review the privacy policies posted at those web
                                    sites or by the relevant service providers.</p> <h3>9. Age limitations</h3> <p>We do not allow use of our Services and the Website by anyone younger than 18 years old. If you learn
                                    that anyone younger than 18 has unlawfully provided us with personal data, please contact us and we
                                    will take steps to delete such information.</p> <h3>10. Your rights</h3> <p>Under certain circumstances, you have following rights under data protection laws in relation to your
                                    personal data:</p> <ol type="a"><li>right to request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the
                                        personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;
                                    </li> <li>right to request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to
                                        have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify
                                        the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
                                    </li> <li>right to request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
                                        personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the
                                        right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised
                                        your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
                                        unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,
                                        however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific
                                        legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;
                                    </li> <li>right to object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate
                                        interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation
                                        which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your
                                        fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
                                        personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
                                        compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and
                                        freedoms;
                                    </li> <li>right to request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to
                                        suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to
                                        establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us
                                        to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need
                                        it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your
                                        data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
                                    </li> <li>right to request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide
                                        to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
                                        machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you
                                        initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform an
                                        agreement with you; and
                                    </li> <li>right to withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal
                                        data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
                                        withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain
                                        Services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
                                    </li></ol> <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
                                    However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
                                    excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p> <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your
                                    right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
                                    measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
                                    We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up
                                    our response.</p> <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer
                                    than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
                                    case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p> <h3>11. Changes to this privacy policy</h3> <p>We may change this Privacy Policy unilaterally and without prior notice, but any changes will be
